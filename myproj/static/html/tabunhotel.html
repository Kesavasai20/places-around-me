        <h1>The TABUN HOTEL</h1>
        <br>
        The tabun hotel is a multicusien restarent .This restarent is more popular in our town every
        one will go to this restarent only.Why means in this restarent the taste will be nice,so 
        that every one will go to this restarent.Beautiful Mandi biriyani experience. Multi-cuisine restaurant,
        but best for Arabian cuisine. Mandi biriyani is a must try for anytime visiting here. The Arabian mixed
        mandi beats them all as you get a variety of non-veg items with the biriyani. Half Mandi should be sufficient
        for 3 people and the full, for easily 6-7 people. The ambience was brilliant, staff are well mannered and it
        was a very different experience altogether in comparison to any other regular restaurant.
